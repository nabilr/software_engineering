### [Requirement Specification](software_requirements.md): Defining the Vision
#### **Capturing What Users Want**  
Sarah, the product manager, starts by gathering everyone: stakeholders, future users, and the technical team. She asks, **“What do we want to achieve?”**

- Passengers want:  
  - **Simple booking options** to enter pickup and drop locations.  
  - **Live tracking** to follow their driver.  
  - **Secure payment methods** like cards or wallets.

- Drivers want:  
  - **Notifications** for ride requests.  
  - A **navigation tool** to find the passenger and their destination.  
  - An **earnings report** to track daily income.

Sarah writes everything down in a **Requirement Specification Document**, organized as:  
1. **Functional Requirements:** What the app must do.  
   - E.g., Book a ride, calculate fares, process payments.  
2. **Non-Functional Requirements:** How the app should perform.  
   - E.g., Scalability to support 1 million users, response time under 1 second.

**Diagram:** A simplified **hierarchy chart** for the requirements:  
```
Ride-Hailing App Requirements
  ├── Passenger Features
  │     ├── Book Ride
  │     ├── Track Driver
  │     └── Payment Integration
  ├── Driver Features

  │     ├── Navigate Routes
  │     └── Track Earnings
  └── Admin Features
        ├── Monitor Rides
        └── Resolve Disputes
```

#### **Why It’s Important:**  
This document acts as the **blueprint** for everything. Without it:  
- Developers won’t know what to build.  
- Stakeholders might have unrealistic expectations.  
- Teams won’t have clear goals to measure success.

**How It Leads to the Next Step:**  
The requirements are handed to Mark, the technical lead, who will assess whether the project is even **possible**.

### [Feasibility Study](feasibility_study.md): Can We Build It?
#### **Reality Check**  
Mark sits down with the technical team, while Emily, the finance manager, reviews the budget. They ask:  
- **Technical Feasibility:**  
  - Mark: “Can we integrate live GPS tracking? Do we have enough server capacity?”  
- **Financial Feasibility:**  
  - Emily: “Can we afford the AWS hosting fees and API costs?”  
- **Time Feasibility:**  
  - Mark: “Can the developers build this within six months?”  

The feasibility study identifies key risks:  
- **Challenge:** GPS APIs like Google Maps are expensive.  
  - **Solution:** Use the free tier initially, and upgrade later.  
- **Challenge:** Real-time notifications need a scalable server.  
  - **Solution:** Use AWS Lambda to handle bursts of traffic.  

**Diagram:** A **feasibility matrix** showing challenges and solutions:

| **Aspect**           | **Challenge**               | **Solution**               | **Decision** |
|-----------------------|-----------------------------|----------------------------|--------------|
| GPS Integration       | High API cost              | Use free tier initially    | ✅ Feasible  |
| Real-Time Notifications | High server demands       | Use AWS Lambda             | ✅ Feasible  |
| Development Budget    | Limited resources          | Hire 3 freelancers         | ✅ Feasible  |

#### **Why It’s Important:**  
A feasibility study ensures the project is:  
1. **Realistic**: No technical surprises mid-way.  
2. **Cost-Effective**: Stays within budget.  
3. **Efficient**: Delivered on time.  

**How It Leads to the Next Step:**  
The feasibility report confirms the project is viable. Now Jane, the UX designer, creates **use cases** to understand user interactions.

---

### [Use cases](usecases.md): Stepping into Users’ Shoes
#### **User Scenarios**  
Jane brainstorms real-world scenarios to understand how users will interact with the app.  

**Passenger Use Case:**  
1. A passenger opens the app and enters their pickup and drop-off locations.  
2. The app matches them with a nearby driver.  
3. The passenger tracks the driver’s arrival and pays after the trip.

**Driver Use Case:**  
1. A driver logs into the app and views ride requests.  
2. They accept a request, navigate to the pickup point, and complete the trip.  

**Edge Case:**  
What if no drivers are available?  
- Jane decides the app should notify the passenger: “No drivers nearby.”

**Diagram:** A **use case diagram** showing interactions:  
```
      +-----------+         +-------------------+
      | Passenger |         |     Driver        |
      +-----------+         +-------------------+
             |                           |
     Book Ride Request            Accept Ride
             |                           |
         Match Driver ------------> Navigate
```

#### **Why It’s Important:**  
Use cases ensure that:  
- All possible interactions (including edge cases) are accounted for.  
- Developers understand **what the system needs to do**.  

**How It Leads to the Next Step:**  
Mark uses these use cases to build **system models**, which map out the app’s technical details.

---

### [System Models](system_model.md): The Technical Blueprint

After the **use cases** are created, Jane, the UX designer, has drawn how the app works from the user’s perspective. For instance:
- Passengers book a ride.  
- Drivers accept requests.  
- Payments are processed.

But now the developers, led by Mark, face a big challenge:  
**"How does this actually work in the system?"**

Mark asks:  
- "When a passenger books a ride, where is the data stored?"  
- "How does the system know which driver to notify?"  
- "What happens if a driver is offline?"  

At this stage, the **use cases** are not enough because they only describe **what happens**, not **how**. This is where **system models** come in.

---

### **What Are System Models?**
System models are like detailed blueprints for the developers. They visualize:
1. **Data Flow:** How information moves between components.  
2. **Relationships:** How the database stores and connects data.  
3. **Processes:** How different parts of the system interact to complete a task.

Imagine building a house:  
- **Use Cases** are like deciding where the bedrooms and kitchen should go.  
- **System Models** are the detailed wiring, plumbing, and structure plans.

---

### **Why Are System Models Needed?**
Without system models:  
- Developers would have no clear idea of how to design the backend.  
- Data storage and interactions might be inconsistent, leading to bugs.  
- Testing would be chaotic since there’s no clear flow to validate.

---

### **A Deep Dive: Building System Models for the Ride-Hailing App**

#### **1. Data Flow Diagram (DFD): Tracking How Data Moves**
Mark begins with a **Data Flow Diagram (DFD)**. It answers:
- Where does data originate?  
- How does it move through the system?  
- Where does it end up?

For example, when a passenger books a ride:
1. The **Passenger** sends a request to the **Server**.  
2. The **Server** matches the passenger with a nearby driver.  
3. The **Driver** is notified.  

**Diagram: Data Flow for "Book a Ride"**

```
Passenger → Request Ride → Server → Notify Driver
           ← Confirmation  ←         ← Acknowledgment
```

**Why It’s Needed:**  
- It clarifies how components communicate, so developers know where APIs are needed.  
- It helps prevent errors, like forgetting to notify the driver.

---

#### **2. Entity-Relationship Diagram (ERD): Structuring the Database**
Next, the team builds the **Entity-Relationship Diagram (ERD)**. This focuses on how data is stored in the database and how different pieces of data are connected.

For example:
- **Users Table**: Stores passenger and driver profiles.  
- **Rides Table**: Tracks ride requests, status (ongoing, completed), and fare.  
- **Payments Table**: Logs payment details.

**Diagram: ERD for the Ride-Hailing App**

```
+---------+          +----------+         +---------+
| Users   |----<     | Rides    |     >---| Payments|
| (UserID)|          |(RideID)  |         |(PayID)  |
+---------+          +----------+         +---------+
```

**Why It’s Needed:**  
- Developers need a database structure to avoid storing redundant or conflicting data.  
- Without an ERD, the system might crash when multiple passengers book rides simultaneously.

---

#### **3. Process Model: Breaking Down System Actions**
Mark then creates a **Process Model** to show what happens at each step in the system. For example, in the **“Match Driver” process**:
1. The **Server** receives the passenger’s location.  
2. It queries the **Database** for nearby drivers.  
3. It sends a notification to the first available driver.  
4. If no driver accepts, the system retries with another driver.

**Diagram: Process Model for "Match Driver"**

```
[Passenger Request] → [Server] → [Database: Find Drivers]
                             ↓
                     [Notify Driver]
                             ↓
                     [Driver Response]
                             ↓
                   [Ride Confirmation]
```

**Why It’s Needed:**  
- It ensures all edge cases (e.g., no drivers available) are accounted for.  
- It helps developers implement logic systematically, avoiding confusion.

---

#### **4. Combining Models: The Big Picture**
Finally, Mark combines all these models into a cohesive view of the system.  

**Diagram: Integrated System Model**

```
[Passenger App] → [Server] → [Database]
      ↓                   ↓
[Ride Request]      [Match Driver]
      ↓                   ↓
[Notify Driver] ← [Driver App]
```

**How It Helps:**  
- The **DFD** ensures data flows correctly.  
- The **ERD** ensures data is stored and retrieved efficiently.  
- The **Process Model** ensures every action is logically handled.

---

### **How System Models Lead to Architecture Design**
With system models in hand, the team can now confidently design the **architecture**:
1. They know how components (passenger app, server, driver app) interact.  
2. They know which services need APIs and how data is stored.  
3. They can optimize performance based on data flow (e.g., caching driver locations).

---

Without system models, the developers would have no guide for implementing the app. System models translate **what users need** into a clear, technical **how-to**, bridging the gap between use cases and architecture. They ensure the ride-hailing app is reliable, efficient, and scalable.

---

###  [Architect's Perpective](architect_perspective.md): Structuring the System
#### **Designing the Foundation**  
With system models ready, Mark’s team creates the app’s architecture.  

**The Challenge:**  
- The app must handle many users without slowing down.  
- It must allow developers to work on different parts independently.  

**The Solution:**  
They decide on a **microservices architecture**:  
1. **User Service:** Handles login, registration, and user profiles.  
2. **Ride Service:** Manages bookings and driver matching.  
3. **Payment Service:** Processes transactions.

Each service is independent but communicates via APIs.

**Diagram:** A high-level architecture diagram:  
```
+------------------+      +------------------+
| User Service     |      | Ride Service     |
| - Login          |----->| - Match Drivers  |
| - Register       |<-----| - Track Rides    |
+------------------+      +------------------+
         |                        |
         v                        v
     +-------------------------------+
     | Payment Service               |
     | - Process Transactions         |
     +-------------------------------+
```

#### **Why It’s Important:**  
The architecture ensures:  
1. **Scalability:** Each service can scale independently.  
2. **Reliability:** If one service fails (e.g., Payment), others still work.  
3. **Maintainability:** Developers can update one service without affecting others.

**How It Leads to the Next Step:**  
The architecture guides implementation and lays the foundation for **testing**.

---

### [Testing](testing.md): Ensuring Quality
#### **The Moment of Truth**  
Sophia, the QA engineer, begins rigorous testing:  
- **Unit Testing:** Does the “Book Ride” button work? Is the fare calculated correctly?  
- **Integration Testing:** Do notifications reach the driver when a ride is booked?  
- **Stress Testing:** Can the system handle 10,000 ride requests simultaneously?  

**Diagram:** A testing workflow:  
```
[Unit Test] --> [Integration Test] --> [System Test] --> [Stress Test]
```

**Why It’s Important:**  
Testing ensures:  
1. **Reliability:** The app works as expected.  
2. **Performance:** It handles real-world traffic smoothly.  
3. **User Satisfaction:** Bugs are minimized.

---

### **Complete Visual Story**
Each step builds on the last, creating a cohesive process:  
```
[Requirement Specification] → [Feasibility Study] → [Use Cases] → [System Models] → [Architecture Design] → [Testing]
```

Through this process, the team successfully launches a ride-hailing app that is functional, scalable, and user-friendly.
