### **The Chronicles of Software Requirements**

In a realm of endless innovation, a group of software developers embarked on a legendary quest to build a perfect system. Their mentor, an experienced guide, welcomed them into the world of **software requirements** and explained, *“Before you can create, you must first understand. Requirements are the foundation of your journey.”*

### **Act 1: The Origin of Requirements**

The mentor began, “A **requirement** is the key to understanding what the system must do and how it should operate. It can range from a high-level abstract idea to a detailed mathematical specification. But beware! Requirements serve a dual purpose:
1. They help you win contracts by describing what the system will achieve.
2. They hold you accountable by specifying what must be delivered.”

---

### **Act 2: The Two Pillars – User and System Requirements**

The team encountered the two central pillars of requirements:

#### **1. User Requirements**
- These are high-level statements written in **natural language** and diagrams.
- Their purpose? To help customers understand the system’s goals.

#### **2. System Requirements**
- These are structured, detailed documents that describe **what needs to be implemented**.
- They serve as a bridge between the developers and the customer, often forming part of the contract.

The mentor explained through an example:
- **User Requirement**: “The software must provide a means of accessing external files.”
- **System Requirement**: “External files must be represented by icons, and users should be able to define, select, and apply tools to these files.”

“Remember,” the mentor said, “User requirements are for dreams, while system requirements are for reality.”

### **Act 3: The Three Types of Requirements**

The developers soon learned of the three types of requirements, each vital to the quest:

#### **1. Functional Requirements**
These describe:
- **What the system should do**.
- **How it reacts** to specific inputs and situations.

**Example (Library System)**:
1. Users must be able to search databases or a subset.
2. The system should provide viewers for reading documents.
3. Each order must have a unique identifier.

#### **2. Non-Functional Requirements**
“These requirements,” the mentor warned, “are just as important as functional ones. If they fail, the system is worthless.”

Non-functional requirements represent **qualities of the system**, including:
- **For users**: Performance, usability, reliability.
- **For developers**: Portability, maintainability.
- **For owners**: Cost and benefits.

**Examples**:
1. **Product**: The interface must use HTML, avoiding Java applets.
2. **Organizational**: Development must follow XYZCo-SP-STAN-95 standards.
3. **External**: Customer data must remain confidential, revealing only names and reference numbers.

#### **3. Domain Requirements**
“These are drawn from the system’s domain,” the mentor explained. “They reflect the unique environment in which the system operates.”

**Example (Library System)**:
- Copyright laws dictate that certain documents must be deleted upon arrival.

### **Act 4: Challenges of the Journey**

The developers faced numerous challenges as they tried to capture these requirements:

1. **Imprecision**:
   Ambiguous terms, such as “appropriate viewers,” led to confusion. Developers and users often interpreted them differently.

2. **Completeness and Consistency**:
   Requirements should describe everything the system needs (**complete**) and avoid contradictions (**consistent**). However, achieving both was rarely possible.

3. **Conflicts in Requirements**:
   For example:
   - In a spacecraft system, reducing the number of chips minimized weight.
   - But using low-power chips required more chips, creating a conflict.
   The developers had to prioritize which requirement mattered most.

---

### **Act 5: Gathering the Knowledge**

To overcome these challenges, the team used various methods to gather and analyze requirements:

#### **1. Observation**
They shadowed users, watching and learning from their daily tasks.

#### **2. Interviews**
They conducted sessions to ask users:
- What do you need?
- What challenges do you face?
- What is your vision for the future?

#### **3. Brainstorming**
In group sessions, they explored ideas with a moderator guiding discussions.

#### **4. Prototyping**
They created:
- **Paper prototypes**: Simple sketches of screens.
- **Mockups**: Functional interfaces to simulate the system.

#### **5. Use Case Analysis**
They analyzed:
- **Actors**: Users or systems interacting with the software.
- **Use Cases**: Scenarios describing how the system would be used.

**Example (ATM System)**:
- **Actors**: User, ATM, Bank.
- **Use Case**: “Withdraw Cash.”
   - **Pre-condition**: User is logged in.
   - **Successful Path**: The system retrieves the balance, validates the withdrawal amount, and disperses cash.

### **Act 6: Recording the Requirements**

With their findings in hand, the developers needed a way to document their requirements clearly. They used:

#### **1. Natural Language**
- Flexible but prone to ambiguity.

#### **2. Structured Language**
- Templates ensured clarity and uniformity.

#### **3. Form-Based Specifications**
- Each function was described with:
  - Inputs, outputs, pre-conditions, post-conditions, and side effects.

**Example (Insulin Pump)**:
- **Function**: Compute insulin dose.
- **Input**: Current and past sugar levels.
- **Output**: Dose to be administered.
- **Side Effects**: None.

#### **4. Tabular Specifications**
- Tables helped represent multiple conditions and outcomes.

**Example**:
| Condition                              | Action                     |
|----------------------------------------|----------------------------|
| Sugar level falling                    | Dose = 0                  |
| Sugar level stable                     | Dose = 0                  |
| Sugar level increasing steadily        | Dose = (ΔSugar)/4         |

#### **5. Graphical Models**
- Diagrams visually depicted processes and relationships.

### **Act 7: The Requirements Document**

Finally, the developers compiled everything into a **requirements document**, a sacred text that would guide the system’s creation. It included:
1. Functional and non-functional requirements.
2. User and system requirements.

The document followed the **IEEE Standard**, which structured it into:
1. Introduction.
2. General Description.
3. Specific Requirements.
4. Appendices.
5. Index.

The mentor emphasized, “This document is not about how the system works—it’s about what the system should do.”

---

### **Act 8: The Key Takeaways**

As their journey neared completion, the developers reflected on what they had learned:
1. Requirements define what the system must do and the constraints on its operation.
2. **Functional requirements** describe the system’s behavior, while **non-functional requirements** define its qualities.
3. Requirements must be clear, consistent, and complete.
4. A well-structured **requirements document** is essential for success.

---

### **Epilogue: A Legacy of Requirements**

With their requirements defined, the developers began building their system. They knew their journey was far from over, but their foundation was strong. Their story became a guiding light for others embarking on the same quest, proving that a solid understanding of requirements could turn dreams into reality.
