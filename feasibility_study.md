## **The Journey of Feasibility: From Vision to Reality**

### **Act 1: The Beginning of the Journey**
In the bustling halls of a government agency, whispers of transformation filled the air. The agency, overwhelmed by mountains of paper-based records, dreamed of moving to a sleek, digital document management system. But dreams alone weren’t enough. Before committing millions to the project, the leadership knew they needed a **feasibility study** to determine if their vision was practical.

A feasibility study is a crucial step taken before starting any major project. It seeks to answer three fundamental questions:
1. Should we **go ahead**?
2. Should we **abandon the project**?
3. Or, should we **reconsider and revise the plan**?

This study would be the first step toward realizing the agency’s digital dream—or shelving it.

### **Act 2: The Challenges of Feasibility**
As the agency embarked on the feasibility study, it quickly encountered significant hurdles:

#### **Uncertainty**:
- Benefits, like improved efficiency, were hard to quantify.
- Resources and timelines were based on rough estimates, leaving room for error.
- Significant organizational changes, such as new workflows and roles, would be necessary.

#### **Advocacy vs. Objectivity**:
- Enthusiasts within the agency passionately pushed the project, highlighting potential benefits while minimizing risks.
- However, those conducting the study and making decisions often had vested interests—career advancement, financial gain, or organizational growth.

The team realized the importance of relying on experienced judgment to navigate these uncertainties.

### **Act 3: Understanding the Decision-Maker’s Perspective**
The agency’s senior leadership, responsible for the final decision, demanded clarity. They posed six critical questions:

1. **Client**: Who will benefit from this system?
2. **Scope**: What are the boundaries of this project? What will and won’t be included?
3. **Benefits**: What organizational advantages can be quantified (e.g., faster response times or reduced manual labor)?
4. **Technical Feasibility**: Is there at least one way to implement this project technically?
5. **Resources**: What will it take in terms of time, staffing, and equipment?
6. **Alternatives**: If we don’t proceed, what are the options?

Their expectations were clear: a well-defined plan addressing scope, risks, and resources, backed by concrete data.

---

### **Act 4: The Importance of Scope**
One of the agency’s biggest lessons was the importance of **scope**—defining what the project would and wouldn’t do. This included:
- **Included functions**: Digital storage and secure retrieval of documents.
- **Excluded functions**: Advanced analytics or AI-driven insights.
- **Dependencies**: Integration with existing systems or third-party software.
- **Replaced systems**: Retiring outdated legacy systems.

The lack of clarity in scope often leads to dissatisfied clients, with statements like:
- **“I assumed the system would include this feature!”**
- **“But I can’t use the system without functionality XYZ.”**

The feasibility study aimed to avoid these pitfalls.

---

### **Act 5: Benefits of the Project**
The team focused on showcasing the benefits, which fell into two categories:

#### **Organizational Benefits**:
1. **Efficiency**: Automating tasks would save staff hours.
2. **Control**: Managing complex systems would become easier.
3. **New Services**: Faster customer response times.
4. **Marketable Product**: Building expertise in handling digital archives.

#### **Technical Feasibility**:
- A preliminary outline of the system design was created, including database and distributed architecture options.
- The team estimated the number of users, data volume, and transactions to project resource requirements.

---

### **Act 6: Planning and Risk Assessment**
#### **Planning**:
A preliminary plan was drafted, which included:
1. Staffing and equipment needs.
2. Major milestones and decision points.
3. Interactions with external systems.
4. Deliverables and timelines.

#### **Risk Assessment**:
The team identified risks in three areas:
1. **Technical Risks**:
   - Could the system scale with growing data?
   - Would existing infrastructure support the new system?
2. **Organizational Risks**:
   - Did the agency have the expertise to manage such a system?
   - Were staff prepared for significant workflow changes?
3. **External Risks**:
   - Would stakeholders commit to necessary efforts?
   - Were there regulatory or legal challenges?

For each risk, the team proposed mitigation strategies and fallback plans.

### **Act 7: Case Studies**
To emphasize the importance of feasibility studies, two real-world examples were analyzed:

#### **Case 1: A Government Agency**
This agency decided to modernize its records system but made the mistake of **approving the project before conducting a feasibility study**. Key issues included:
- **Organizational Unpreparedness**: Senior management lacked the expertise to oversee a transformative project.
- **Scope Confusion**: The agency didn’t study data volumes or access policies beforehand.
- **Outcome**: The project faced significant problems during implementation.

#### **Case 2: A Government Library**
The library commissioned a digital repository system, but unclear scope caused confusion:
- The library assumed the system would validate and load materials.
- The contractor, however, considered these tasks outside the project’s scope.
A proper feasibility study could have prevented this misunderstanding.

---

### **Act 8: The Feasibility Report**
The final deliverable of the study was the **feasibility report**, a document designed for a diverse audience—clients, financial managers, and technical teams. The report needed to:
1. Be concise and easy to read.
2. Cover essential topics like risks, benefits, and scope.
3. Include supporting documents for additional detail.

The report served as the foundation for the agency’s decision-making process.

---

### **Checklist for Feasibility Studies**
As the team concluded their work, they used a checklist to ensure all bases were covered:
1. **Team**: Do we have skilled members with enough time?
2. **Timeline**: Can the project be completed on schedule?
3. **Equipment and Software**: Are necessary tools and licenses available?
4. **Client Involvement**: Is the client ready and accessible?
5. **Startup Time**: Does the team need time to learn new systems or tools?
6. **Business Considerations**: Are there licensing or trade-secret issues?

---

### **Act 9: The Final Decision**
With the feasibility report in hand, the agency’s leadership faced the moment of truth. They weighed the benefits, risks, and resource requirements. Ultimately, the feasibility study empowered them to make an informed decision—whether to proceed with confidence, revise the plan, or abandon the project.
